# SocialNet-Sociopedia

I'm excited to share the completion of a project developed using the MERN stack! Huge shoutout and credits to EdRoh, an exceptional YouTuber whose tutorials served to learn so many things about the MERN stack.

## Description

SocialNet-Sociopedia is a social media platform where people can gather to make friends, share their thoughts, and build meaningful connections.

## Key Achievements

- **Coding Standards**: Implemented coding standards for a maintainable codebase.
- **Responsive UI**: Crafted a responsive user interface for a seamless user experience.
- **Authentication Middleware**: Developed middleware for authentication to ensure data security.
- **Backend Knowledge**: Expanded backend knowledge through hands-on experience with MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js.
- **Feature Addition**: Implemented a feature that enables users to delete their own posts directly from their profile page.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React.js
- Node.js
- Redux

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MaanLad/React_Social_Media
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd socialnet
    ```
3. Install the dependencies for both the server and client:
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```
4. Set up your environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the server directory and add the necessary configuration:
    ```
    MONGO_URI=your_mongo_db_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    ```

5. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm start
    cd ../client
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

Once the server and client are both running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You can create an account, log in, make friends, share your thoughts, and delete your own posts directly from your profile page.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
6. Create a new Pull Request.

It was so much fun to develop such a project. I learned so many things, and with this project, I believe that it's a great kickstart for me as a MERN stack developer.

Meet you soon again with my own new project!
